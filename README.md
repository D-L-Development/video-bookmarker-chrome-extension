# Web Video Bookmarks

## Introduction

Web Video Bookmarks is a Chrome extension designed to help users organize their notes into an easy-to-understand file
system.
The extension looks for a video in the document and uses it to allow the user to add annotations to certain times in the
video.
The user is able to add annotations and edit annotations, as well as jump to certain key points in the video based on
the timestamp.
Although the annotations are persistent in the browser, you can still download any annotations as a pdf format to view
later
or share with your peers.
